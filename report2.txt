i think i resolved my last git bug but now i am having a different problem of my ai running pretty slowly and eventually only returning the same move (if i do auto white to have 2 ais play against each other, they eventually just keep going back and forth with the same 2 moves).  I think this has something to do with my winner because at this point somebody should have one which is why my ai cannot come up with logical moves, but i tested my winner function and it seems to be working and im not sure where this is going wrong.  Thanks.
