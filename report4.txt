When a game plays all the way through and a winner is reported, my program does not always function the way it is supposed to.  For example, if you type dump or quit after the winner of a game is reported, both of those functions work correctly it appears.  But if after a first game reports a winner if i type new and then attempt to play a game, nothing happens.  There is no error message, it just does not work.  I tried debugging with breakpoints at my doNew command and was still not able to see exactly where this is going wrong.
