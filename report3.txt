UPDATED: i was in earlier and we talked about for winner to work, someone needs to be completely blocked in and it needs to be their turn again in order for the other player to win.  I think i implemented this but it is still not working -- I am passing the integration tests for playOne and quickwin, but not for playTwo.  I went to office hours today to see why this was happening, and the TA Michelle was also very confused and said she thinks my code should be working.  She went back to her own computer to make sure that the test was working, and found that it was, but could not see a reason that mine was not. we ran python3 test-amazons --verbose with both playTwo files and she still could not figure out what was going wrong.  She said it appeared that my first machine was making a move which was getting manually inputted to the second machine, but then that second machine would not respond.
