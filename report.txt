the problem I am having is when i try to run my AI, it is trying to move white pieces even though its turn is black, or at least that is how the problem is presenting itself.  I originally implemented my AI using board copies and making one move per copy and a new copy was at every node, which seemed to function ok except for the fact that it was very slow.  So now i commented that implementation out, and attempted to implement my AI by actually making the moves and then undoing them.  I am now no longer able to play my game because i keep getting an error.  The error is "not this piece's turn", which I decided to throw/implement.  I have stepped through the debugger and am still not sure why this is happening.  Also, in the debugger it does not seem to be happening on the first move, yet it is still happening in the first move.  I spent my whole day at OH and the project party, I would really appreciate some help.  Thank you.
